class ProcessLink:
    """Used for bidirectional monitoring and control channel between two processes.

    When a linked process terminates, the `on_link_closed` callback provided in `start()` will be called.
    This way both the parent and child process know when any of them terminated.

    Note that:
     * you MUST call `start()` on the link in both parent and child processes
     * the callback will be called from a thread

    Typically, you would use it like this:
        import time

        # Child process worker
        def worker(link):
            # Required for the link to work
            link.start()
            # Do some work
            time.sleep(1)

        # Parent process
        link = ProcessLink()
        child = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker, args=(link,))
        child.start()

        link.start(on_link_closed=lambda l: print('child closed'))
        link.join() # Wait until the other side is terminated

    See tests/unit/test_process_link.py for more examples.

    The main idea behind this is to create pipes shared between child and parent processes.
    When any process terminates, the other one will receive errors when reading the pipe.

    We could use the `signal` module (registering for SIGCHLD), but this approach has several problems:
     - registering for SIGCHLD is not available on Windows
     - registering for SIGCHLD is brittle, because users might register their own signal handlers, which would either
       break our library, or user code
     - the child process has no way to detect if the parent process dies
